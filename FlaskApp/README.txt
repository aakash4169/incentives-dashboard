Python Version: 3.6
Required Python Packages:
   flask
   scrapy
   pandas
   numpy

I would recommend creating an environment to download these packages. You can do this most easily by installing Anaconda and using the Anaconda Navigator. Click on Environments, create a new environment, install the packages above, then in command line, type
   activate <environment-name>

To run through command line, cd into the project folder and type:
   python flaskdashboard.py

When it is running, navigate to localhost:5000
