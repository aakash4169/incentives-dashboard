Recruiting Workers The BITP provides financial assistance to recruit workforce required for new and expanding businesses and industries in Arkansas. Workers are usually recruited through newspaper ads, but other forms of recruitment may be used. The company-specific recruitment can include working with the Department of Workforce Services office, locating a site to receive applications and providing temporary help for receiving applications. Pre-employment Training For more than 35 years, AEDC has operated a successful pre-employment training program for new and expanding companies, customizing the number of hours and content of the training to fit the specific needs of each company. Trainees are required to sign an affidavit that relieves the company and AEDC of any obligations to the trainee. Pre-employment training is a plus for both the company and the trainees. It gives the trainees an opportunity to look at the company and the job, and the company an opportunity to view trainees before they are hired. Business & Industry Training Program project managers work with AEDC's Business Development team when negotiating with new and expanding companies. The project manager then works closely with the company throughout the training project, meeting with the local educational institution and the company coordinator to find the best trainers for the company's needs. If the company chooses to use its own out-of-state trainers for the pre-employment training, AEDC provides financial assistance for travel and lodging. Train the Trainer If the company chooses to send trainers from Arkansas to another plant location so they can learn to train trainees in Arkansas, the BITP provides financial assistance for travel and lodging. On-the-Job Training Following pre-employment training, if the trainee is hired by the company, AEDC helps pay the instructional costs to train the new employee. Hours of instruction and the number of instructors depend on the types of jobs that require on-the-job training. Financial assistance is not allowed for salary of trainees or new hires.","state":"Arkansas","website":"http://arkansasedc.com/incentives/existing-business-resource","business_needs":["Workforce prep or development"],"geographic_focus":["Statewide"],"program_category":["Direct Business Financing"],"program_industries":[],"program_type":["Grant"]}
